Description: server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language (FPM-CGI binary)
 This package provides the Fast Process Manager interpreter that runs
 as a daemon and receives Fast/CGI requests. 
 This package is php-fpm in 'tills special flavour'.
 PHP5 is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed
 from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown
 in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically
 generated pages quickly. This version of PHP5 was built with the Suhosin patch.
